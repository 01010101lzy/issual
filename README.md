# iL 0.3.0 "Asahi"

**UPDATE 0.3.0 INVOLVES A POSSIBLIY BREAKING UPDATE. PLEASE UNINSTALL AND**
**INSTALL AGAIN IF YOU MEET ANY BUG!**

iL (codename "Issual") is a Todo Manager with nothing special. The name "iL"
does not hold any special meanings, it's just a meaningless name for a course
design homework.

This project is not tested with iOS devices, and should only be run on Android.
I'd be appreciated if _someone_ would like to test and release an iOS version
of it.
