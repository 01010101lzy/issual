# iL

iL (codename "Issual") is purely a Todo manager with some handy features. Its
name "iL" does not hold any special meanings.

iL is a Course Design work of the "Hands-on With Software Design" course in
BUAA. Not sure if I'll continue to work on this after the course is done.

This project is not tested with iOS devices, and should only be run on Android.
If _someone_ would like to test and release an iOS version of it, PLZ DO THAT!

## Features

- Regular todo items managing
- Categorizing todo items

  Active, Pending, Canceled. User addition Soon™.
